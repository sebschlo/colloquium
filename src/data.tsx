      <h3>A Data Manifesto</h3>
      <p>
        Collecting data can be an immensely tedious task. Whenever possible, I
        believe it is essential to leverage automated, continuous collection.
        The data I'm using have been collected for years in the background
        without effort from my part. Of course, they afford a utilitarian view
        of myself as a commodity to be advertised to, but this doesn't prevent
        the reclaiming of it for the gleaning of alternative insights.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        When the hypothesis in question is too broad and complex, I believe
        taking an individual case perspective can help illuminate the key levers
        of the system. In this case, the environmental cost of online shopping
        vs. brick-and-mortar is impossible to calculate. The nature of this
        problem is collective at heart, and one person won't influence the
        whole. However, we make decisions on a daily basis, that in aggregate do
        matter. How else can we guide our choices other than by analyzing our
        particular situation with the data at hand?
